# Rock-Paper-Scissors TCP Game

A simple client-server implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Java and TCP sockets. Two players can connect and play in real time over a network.

## Overview

This project demonstrates basic networking concepts in Java using TCP sockets. It includes:

- A server that handles multiple client connections
- A client that sends player choices to the server
- Game logic to determine the winner
- Console-based interaction

## Technologies

- Java
- TCP Sockets (`java.net.Socket`, `java.net.ServerSocket`)
- Multithreading (`java.lang.Thread`)
